***Nonparametric multiple-output center-outward quantile regression***

### Overview

This is an implementation of the multivariate quantile regression method described in the manuscript "Nonparametric Multiple-Output
Center-Outward Quantile Regression". It relies on a multivariate extension of the notion of quantile via optimal transportation.


The code is under active development and should be considered as
`alpha stage' software.

***Nonparametric multiple-output center-outward quantile regression***

### Overview

This is an implementation of the multivariate quantile regression method described in the manuscript "Nonparametric Multiple-Output
Center-Outward Quantile Regression". It relies on a multivariate extension of the notion of quantile via optimal transportation.


The code is included for the sake of reproducibility and should be considered as `alpha stage' software.

### Contents

The main method for multiple-output center-outward quantile regression based on $k$-nearest neighbor weights is implemented. We provide R and Python code. Most of the figures in the main manuscript have been produced with the R code.
